And how long have you been here?”</p><p>“About three weeks.”</p><p>“Good Heaven! what an anxious search have I had, to discover your abode, since you so suddenly left town!

Oh, Miss Anville, did you know what I have endured! the sleepless, restless state of suspense I have been tortured with, you could not, all cruel as you are, you could not have received me with such frigid indifference?”</p><p>“Received you, Sir!”</p><p>“Why, is not my visit to you?” Do you think I should have made this journey, but for the happiness of again seeing you?”</p><p>“Indeed it is possible I might,-since so many others do.”</p></div> </div>
