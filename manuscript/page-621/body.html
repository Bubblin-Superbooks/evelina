but my
recollection was soon awakened by a stranger’s addressing me with, “Come along with me, my dear, and I’ll take care of you.”</p><p>I started; and then, to my great terror, perceived that I had outrun all my companions, and saw not one human being I knew! With all the speed in my power, and forgetful of my first fright, I hastened back to the place I had left;-but found the form occupied by a new set of people.</p></div> </div>
