entertainment
had displeased the Captain; and his displeasure, I believe, disconcerted us all.</p><p>And here I thought to have concluded my letter; but, to my great
surprise, just now we had a visit from Lord Orville. He called, he said, to
pay his respects to us before we left town, and made many inquiries
concerning our return; and, when Mrs Mirvan told him we were going
into the country without any view of again quitting it, he expressed
concern in such terms-so polite, so flattering, so serious-that I
could hardly forbear being sorry for myself. Were I to go immediately
to Berry Hill, I am sure I should feel nothing but joy;-but, now we
are joined by this Captain, and Madame Duval, I must own I expect
very little pleasure at Howard Grove.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Before Lord Orville went, Sir Clement Willoughby</p></div> </div>
