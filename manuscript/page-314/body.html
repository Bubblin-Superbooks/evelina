Mr. Villars</h4><p class="  start-chapter">Howard Grove.</p><p>Dear Sir,</p><p>I CANNOT give a greater proof of the high opinion I have of your candour, than by the liberty I am now going to take, of presuming to offer you advice, upon a subject concerning which you have so just a claim to act for yourself; but I know you have too unaffected a love of justice, to be partially tenacious of your own judgment.</p><p>Madame Duval has been proposing a scheme which has put us all in
commotion, and against which, at first, in common with the rest of my family, I exclaimed: but, upon more mature consideration, I own my objections
have almost wholly vanished.</p></div> </div>
