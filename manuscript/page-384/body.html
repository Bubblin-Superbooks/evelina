to the
relief of Madame Duval,-I cannot bear that she should be treated with
such indignity.”</p><p>“And will you,-can you command my absence?-When may I speak to you, if not
now?-Does the Captain suffer me to breathe a moment out of his
sight?-and are not a thousand impertinent people for ever at your
elbow?”</p><p>“Indeed, Sir Clement, you must change your style, or I will not hear
you. The
impertinent people you mean are among my best friends; and you would
not, if you really wished me well, speak of them so disrespectfully.”</p><p>“Wish you well!-O, Miss Anville, point but out to me how, in what
manner, I
may convince you of the fervour of my passion;-tell me but what
services you will accept from me,-and you shall find my life, my
fortune, my whole soul at your devotion.”</p></div> </div>
