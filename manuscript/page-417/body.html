<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">honour to convince your Ladyship of this truth, in regard
to Mr. Villars and myself.</p><p>As to the young lady, whom Mr. Villars so obligingly proposes
presenting to
me, I wish her all the happiness to which, by your ladyship’s account, she seems entitled; and, if she has a third part of the merit of her
to whom you compare her, I doubt not but Mr. Villars will be more
successful in every other application he may make for her advantage, that he can ever be in any with which he may be pleased to favour me.
I have the honour to be Madam, Your Ladyship’s most humble, and most
obedient servant, JOHN BELMONT.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
