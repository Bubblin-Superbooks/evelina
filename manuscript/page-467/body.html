And do you?”</p><p>As he spoke he advanced towards me; and I, still guarding the pistols, retreated, saying, “No, no-you must not-must not have them!”</p><p>“Why-for what purpose, tell me!-do you withhold them?"-</p><p>“To give you time to think,-to save you from eternal misery; -and, I hope, to reserve you for mercy and forgiveness.”</p></div> </div>
