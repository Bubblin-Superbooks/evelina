What say you? for my part I think it was a very good motion.”</p><p>“If my cousin likes it,” said Miss Branghton, “I’m sure I’ve no objection.”</p><p>“O,” cried he, “I always study what the ladies like,-that’s my first thought. And, indeed, it is but natural that you should like best to sit by the gentlemen, for what can you find to say to one another?”</p><p>“Say!” cried young Branghton; “O, never you think of that, they’ll find enough to say, I’ll be sworn.
