her head
had sustained, and called out, “My God! what is become of my hair?-why, the villain has stole all my curls!”</p><p>She then ordered the man to run and see if he could find any of them

impudentest fellow ever I see; and if I find you dare grin at me any
more, I shall make no ceremony of boxing your ears.”</p></div> </div>
