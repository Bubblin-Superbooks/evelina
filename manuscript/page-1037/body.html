Grieve not at the inevitable moment! but may thy own end be equally propitious! Oh, mayâ€™st thou, when full of days, and full of honour, sink down as gently to rest!-be loved as kindly, watched as tenderly, as thy happy father! And mayest thou, when thy glass is run, be sweetly, but not bitterly, mourned by some remaining darling of thy affections-some yet surviving Evelina!</p><p>-ARTHUR VILLARS.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
