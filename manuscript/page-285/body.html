extraordinary; though, perhaps, you may persuade her that her pug
nose is all the fashion; and as to the other, why she’s good white
and red to be sure; but what of that?-I’ll warrant she’ll moulder
away as fast as her neighbours.”</p><p>“Is there,” cried Lord -, “another man in this place, who, seeing such
objects, could make such a speech?”</p><p>“As to that there,” returned the Captain, “I don’t know whether
there be or
no, and, to make free, I don’t care; for I sha’n’t go for to model
myself by any of these fair-weather chaps, who dare not so much
as say their souls are their own,-and, for aught I know, no more

a Frenchman, and I believe in my heart there i’n’t a pin to choose
between them; and, before long, we shall hear the very sailors talking
that lingo, and see never a swabber without a bag and a sword.”</p></div> </div>
