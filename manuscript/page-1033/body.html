<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Selwyn; and myself with Lord Orville.</p><p>We had hardly proceeded half a mile, when a gentleman from the post-chaise which came gallopping after us, called out to the servants, “Holla, my lads!-pray, is one Miss Anville in any of them thing-em-bobs?”</p><p>I immediately recollected the voice of Captain Mirvan; and Lord Orville stopped the phaeton. He was out of the chaise, and with us in a moment. “So, Miss Anville,” cried he, “how do you do? So I hear you’re Miss Belmont now;-pray, how does old Madame French do?”</p><p>“Madame Duval,” said I, “is, I believe, very well.”</p><p>“I hope she is in good case,” said he, winking significantly, “and won’t flinch at seeing service: she has laid by long enough to refit and be made tight. And pray how does poor Monseer Doleful do? Is he as lank-jawed as ever?”</p><p>“They are neither of them,” said I, “in Bristol.”</p></div> </div>
