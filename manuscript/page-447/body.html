Polly and I always go and sit there when we’ve cleaned ourselves.”</p><p>“Yes, Miss,” cried the brother, “they do nothing else all day long, when father don’t scold them. But the best fun is, when they’ve got all their dirty things on, and all their hair about their ears, sometimes I send young Brown up stairs to them: and then there’s such a fuss!-There, they hide themselves, and run away, and squeal and squall, like any thing mad: and so then I puts the two cats into the room, and I gives them a good whipping, and so that sets them a squalling too; so there’s such a noise and such an uproar!-Lord, you can’t think, Miss, what fun it is!”</p><p>This occasioned a fresh quarrel with the sisters; at the end of which, it was at length decided that we should go to the shop.</p></div> </div>
