Never were surprise and concern so strongly marked:-yes, my dear Sir, he looked greatly concerned: and that, the remembrance of that, is the only consolation I feel for an evening the most painful of my life.</p><p>What he said I know not; for indeed, I seemed to have neither ears nor understanding; but I recollect that I only courtsied in silence.
