time of my going to the Hot Wells.</p><p>Mrs. Beaumont lent me her chariot, and Lord Orville absolutely
insisted upon
attending me. “If you go alone,” said he, “Mrs. Selwyn will certainly
be offended; but if you allow me to conduct you, though she may give
the freer scope to her raillery, she cannot possibly be affronted:
and we had much better suffer her laughter, than provoke her satire.”</p><p>Indeed, I must own, I had no reason to regret being so accompanied;
for his
conversation supported my spirits from drooping, and made the ride
seem so short, that we actually stopped at my father’s door, before
I knew we had proceeded ten yards.</p><p>He handed me from the carriage, and conducted me to the parlour, at the door
of which I was met by Mr. Macartney. “Ah, my dear brother,” cried I, “how happy am I to see you here!”</p></div> </div>
