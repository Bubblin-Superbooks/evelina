THE solemn manner in which you have committed your child to my care, has in some measure damped the pleasure which I receive from the trust, as it makes me fear that you suffer from your compliance, in which case I shall very sincerely blame myself for the earnestness with which I have requested this favour: but remember, my good Sir, she is within a few days summons; and be assured, I will not detain her a moment longer than you wish.</p><p>You desire my opinion of her.</p><p>She is a little angel! I cannot wonder that you sought to monopolize her: neither ought you, at finding it impossible.</p></div> </div>
