I screamed aloud with fear; and forcibly snatching it away, I ran hastily up to two ladies, and cried, “for Heaven’s sake, dear ladies, afford me some protection!”</p><p>They heard me with a loud laugh, but very readily said, “Ay, let her walk between us;” and each of them took hold of an arm.</p><p>Then, in a drawling, ironical tone of voice, they asked what had frightened my little Ladyship? I told them my adventure very simply, and intreated they would have the goodness to assist me in finding my friends.</p></div> </div>
