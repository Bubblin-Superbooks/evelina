But I’m a sad, weak creature;-don’t you think I am, my Lord?” )</p><p>“O, by no means,” answered he, “your Ladyship is merely delicate,-and devil take me if ever I had the least passion for an Amazon.”</p><p>“I have the honour to be quite of your Lordship’s opinion,” said Mr. Lovel, looking maliciously at Mrs. Selwyn; “for I have an insuperable aversion to strength, either of body or mind, in a female.”</p></div> </div>
